                        8-bit microcontrollers are the stepping stones for any electronics/embedded engineer or maker, but we all know that these are not sufficient. Industry-recognized microcontrollers are based on ARM Cortex architecture. For most people, shifting to these microcontrollers is either too difficult or the path is confusing/unclear. The STM32 Step-Up Board solves these problems by making everything easier for any beginner to transition to industry-recognized microcontrollers. The STM32 Step-Up board is an STM32F103C8T6 32-bit ARM microcontroller-based development board designed with beginners in mind. This will be achieved by:
                        
                        <br>1. Bridging the design flaws you will find in many STM32 boards.<br>
                        2. Preloading the bootloader so you do not have to face the hassle of programmers and flashing bootloaders. You can directly program the controller and get started with your engineering journey.
                        <br>3. Very shortly, ElectronHub will release getting started written and visual tutorials for the board, which will cover common topics so that you can kick-start your journey with the controller board with ease. Arduino IDE and STM CubeIDE will be used for the same."
